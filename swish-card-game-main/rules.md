# Swish – Game Rules

## Objective
The goal of *Swish* is to be the first player to get rid of all cards, including hand cards and face-down cards.

---

## Setup
- Each player is dealt 6 face-down cards, arranged in 3 columns of 2 cards each.  
  - These remain hidden until the endgame.  
- Each player is also dealt 5 cards into their hand.  
- The remaining deck is placed in the center for drawing.  

---

## Turn Sequence
1. On their turn, a player must discard at least one card.  
   - They may discard multiple cards of the same rank (e.g., three 4s, two Kings).  
2. After discarding, the player draws from the deck until their hand has 5 cards.  
   - Once the deck is empty, players continue only with their remaining hand cards.  
3. The next player must then attempt to beat the top card (or set) on the discard pile.  

---

## Card Ranks
- Standard rank order: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, J, Q, K  
- Power Cards: A, 2, 10  

---

## Power Card Rules
- Ace (A) 
  - Can beat any card.  
  - Only beaten by another Ace or any other power card (2 or 10).  

- Two (2)  
  - Resets the pile.  
  - The player must immediately play another card (any choice).  
  - Examples: `2,3`, `2,6,6`, `2,10`.  

- Ten (10)  
  - Acts as a bomb.  
  - Destroys the entire discard pile (removed from play, including the 10 itself).  
  - The player must then immediately play another card to restart the pile.  

- Four of a Kind (Bomb Equivalent)  
  - If four cards of the same rank are played consecutively without interruption, the pile is destroyed (same effect as a 10).  
  - This can occur if:  
    - A single player plays all four at once.  
    - Two players build it across turns (e.g., Player 1 plays `3,3` and Player 2 immediately plays `3,3`).  
    - Or Player 1 plays `3` and Player 2 follows with `3,3,3`.  
  - The player who completes the set of four triggers the bomb effect.  
  - If another card is played in between, the effect is lost.  

---

## Picking Up the Pile
- If a player cannot beat the top card, they must:  
  1. Pick up the entire discard pile into their hand.  
  2. The opponent who played last restarts with a card of their choice.  
- If a player ends up with more than 5 cards, they must play those down before drawing again.  

---

## Endgame (Face-Down Cards)
- Once a player empties their hand, they begin flipping their 6 face-down cards one at a time.  
- They must attempt to play the revealed card.  
- If the revealed card cannot beat the top of the pile:  
  - The player must pick up the entire pile.  
  - They must play those cards before returning to face-down cards.  

---

## Winning
- The first player to discard all cards — both hand cards and face-down cards — wins the game.
